# MelbDjango School Lesson Eight

### The "Project"

Our [project][project] outline is online. Make something awesome.

---

Congratulations, you've made it to the git repository for our eighth lesson. Hopefully you also made it to the class and some of this makes sense to you.

Check our RESOURCES.md for some links we think you'll find handy.


## Homework Checklist

- [ ] [Fork this repository][gh-fork]
- [ ] Clone the repo to your own machine
- [ ] Use the virtualenv you created in previous lesson
- [ ] Make sure timetracker entries are only accessible by the user that created it
- [ ] Make sure clients and projects can only be changed by their creator
- [ ] Deploy your application to Heroku and email a link to [Brenton](brenton@commoncode.com.au).
- [ ] Bonus: On the project list view, show how much time was spent per project in total and how much time the current user spent

We're hoping to organise a **prize** for people that have made it this far. We're asking you to email Brenton so that we have some contact details for you.

When you've completed some or all of the homework please make a [Pull Request][gh-pr] against this repository. If you submit your work before Wednesday evening we'll give you feedback before the next class.

If you'd like help, make a Pull Request with your incomplete work and ask a question to @darrenfrenkel, @sesh, @funkybob or @MarkusH
